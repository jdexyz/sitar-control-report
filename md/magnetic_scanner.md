# An Open Magnetic Scanner

To visualise the fields generated by the electromagnetic actuators, we built a magnetic scanner, using a CNC mill as a base.

The design choices and the build process are detailed [here](/magnetic_scanner_design).

Some early results are shown [here](/magnetic_scanner_results).
