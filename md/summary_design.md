# Summary of the design

![A visual summary of the test instrument design](../img/setup.jpg)

To sum up, the test instrument uses a shielded piezo sensor integrated in a single bass bridge for input, a Bela microcontroller for processing and communication, a current-output amplifier with its power supply for signal amplification, and a magnetic actuator (either the E-77-88 or the WF-P25/20). 

Since we wanted to better understand the magnetic field generated by the actuator, we built a magnetic scanner, from a 3D printer and later a CNC mill. The design choices of this project are shown in the [next section](magnetic_scanner_design).
