abstract = {This paper presents a sliding Goertzel algorithm to accurately estimate the Fourier coefficients of multifrequency (MF) sinusoidal signals buried in noise. The algorithm is based on second-order digital resonators that are tuned at the desired frequencies. The proposed method provides the following advantages when compared with the conventional Goertzel algorithm. Firstly, it computes Fourier coefficients in less than one signal period. Therefore, faster detection time is achieved, particularly when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the input frequencies is small. Secondly, it is less prone to numerical overflow problems in fixed-point arithmetic implementation. Thirdly, the algorithm is quite suitable for time varying sinusoidal signal estimation. An analysis is undertaken to provide additional insight into the issue of required acquisition time versus the desired accuracy for the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation tests are also included to demonstrate its performance.},

abstract = {The nonequispaced Fourier transform arises in a variety of application area:, from medical imaging to radio astronomy to the numerical solution of partial differential equations. In a typical problem, one is given an irregular sampling of N data in the frequency domain and one is interested in reconstructing the corresponding function in the physical domain. When the sampling is uniform, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) allows this calculation to be computed in O(N log N) operations rather than O(N-2) operations. Unfortunately, when the sampling is nonuniform, the FFT does not apply. Over the last few years, a number of algorithms have been developed to overcome this limitation and are often referred to as nonuniform FFTs (NUFFTs). These rely on a mixture of interpolation and the judicious use of the FFT on an oversampled grid (A. Dutt and V. Rokhlin, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 14 (1993), pp. 1368-1383). In this paper, we observe that one of the standard interpolation or "gridding" schemes, based on Gaussians, can be accelerated by a significant factor without precomputation and storage of the interpolation weights. This is of particular value in two- and three-dimensional settings, saving either 10(d)N in storage in d dimensions or a factor of about 5-10 in CPU time (independent of dimension).},

abstract = {The sliding DFT process for spectrum analysis was presented and shown to be more efficient than the popular Goertzel (1958) algorithm for sample-by-sample DFT bin computations. The sliding DFT provides computational advantages over the traditional DFT or FFT for many applications requiring successive output calculations, especially when only a subset of the DFT output bins are required. Methods for output stabilization as well as time-domain data windowing by means of frequency-domain convolution were also discussed. A modified sliding DFT algorithm, called the sliding Goertzel DFT, was proposed to further reduce the computational workload. We start our sliding DFT discussion by providing a review of the Goertzel algorithm and use its behavior as a yardstick to evaluate the performance of the sliding DFT technique. We examine stability issues regarding the sliding DFT implementation as well as review the process of frequency-domain convolution to accomplish time-domain windowing. Finally, a modified sliding DFT structure is proposed that provides improved computational efficiency.},

abstract = {The need for efficient detection of Dual-tone Multifrequency (DTMF) tones for developing telecommunication equipment is justifiable. This paper presents an artificial intelligence based approach for efficient detection of DTMF tones under the influence of White Gaussian Noise (WGN) and frequency variation, using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Additive WGN in the DTMF input samples is removed by filtering out unwanted frequencies. Detection of DTMF carrier frequencies from input samples employs a traditional software based approach using the power spectrum analysis of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) signals. The Goertzel's Algorithm is used to estimate the seven fundamental DTMF carrier frequencies. A SVM classifier is trained using the estimated fundamental DTMF carrier frequencies, and is validated using the input samples for classification of low and high DTMF frequency groups. The tone detection scheme employs decision logic using a rule-base expert system for classification of low and high DTMF frequency groups, corresponding to valid DTMF frequency groups. Comparison of this hybrid DTMF tone detection model with existing DTMF detection techniques proves the merits of this proposed scheme. This hybrid DTMF tone detection scheme is simulated in a MATLAB environment and results from performance tests are given in this paper.},

abstract = {Abstract In recent years, there has been a growing interest in smart structures, particularly in the field of musical acoustics. Control methods, initially developed to reduce vibration and damage, can be a good way to shift modal parameters of a structure in order to modify its dynamic response. This study focuses on smart musical instruments and aims to modify their radiated sound. This is achieved by controlling the modal parameters of the soundboard of a simplified string instrument. A method combining a pole placement algorithm and a time-dimensionless state-derivative control is used and quickly compared to a usual state control method. Then the effect of the mode tuning on the coupling between the string and the soundboard is experimentally studied. Controlling two vibration modes of the soundboard, its acoustic response and the damping of the third partial of the sound are modified. Finally these effects are listened in the radiated sound.},

A state-space model that emulates the behavior of the string is introduced, and we explain the theory behind band pass filter control and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control as applied to a vibrating string. After describing the characteristics of various actuators and sensors, we motivate the choice of collocated electromagnetic actuators and a multi- axis piezoelectric bridge sensor. Integral control is shown experimentally to be capable of damping the string independently of the fundamental frequency. Finally, we consider the difference between damping the energy in only one transverse axis, versus simultaneously damping the energy in both the vertical and horizontal transverse axes.},

abstract = {Several different approaches are described to the problem of synthesising the pluck response of a guitar, starting from information about string properties and the input admittance at the bridge of the guitar. Synthesis can be carried out in the frequency domain, the time domain, or via modal superposition. Within these categories there are further options. A range of methods is developed and implemented, and their performance on a particular test case compared. The two most successful methods are found to be modal synthesis using the first-order method, and frequency-domain synthesis. Of the two, frequency domain synthesis proves to be faster. A significant conclusion is that the coupled string/body modes of a normal classical guitar do not show veering behaviour except at low frequencies, so that it is important to use a synthesis method which incorporates fully the effect of string damping: methods based on first finding undamped modes give poor results.},

abstract = {The predictions of a calibrated synthesis model for the coupled string/body vibration of a guitar are compared with measurements. A reasonably good match is demonstrated at low frequencies, except that some individual decay rates of ‚Äústring modes‚Äù are hard to match correctly. It is shown to be essential to use an accurate damping model for the string: the intrinsic damping of the classical guitar strings used here is found to vary by an order of magnitude in the audible frequency range. At higher frequencies, two phenomena not included in the synthesis model are found to produce disparities between measurement and synthesis. First, the two polarisations of string motion show modal frequencies which are split further apart than can be explained by body coupling. This effect is tentatively attributed to slight rolling on the fret and/or bridge, resulting in different effective lengths for the two polarisations. Second, unexpected extra peaks are seen in the measured spectra, which are frequencydoubled relatives of the expected peaks due to transverse string resonances. The non-linear mechanism creating these additional peaks is presumed to involve excitation of longitudinal string motion by the transverse vibration.},

We model the magnet and ferromagnetic wire as surfaces with magnetic charge and construct an intuitive model that accurately predicts the output of a magnetic guitar pickup. This model can be understood by undergraduate students and provides an excellent learning tool due to its straightforward mathematics and intuitive algorithm. Experiments show that it predicts the change in a magnetic field due to the presence of a ferromagnetic wire with a high degree of accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a synthesis of analytical calculations of magnetic parameters (field, force, torque, stiffness) in cylindrical magnets and coils. By using the equivalence between the amperian current model and the coulombian model of a magnet, we show that a thin coil or a cylindrical magnet axially magnetized have the same mathematical model. Consequently, we present first the analytical expressions of the magnetic field produced by either a thin coil or a ring permanent magnet whose polarization is axial, thus completing similar calculations already published in the scientific literature. Then, this paper deals with the analytical calculation of the force and the stiffness between thin coils or ring permanent magnets axially magnetized. Such configurations can also be modeled with the same mathematical approach. Finally, this paper presents an analytical model of the mutual inductance between two thin coils in air. Throughout this paper, we emphasize why the equivalence between the coulombian and the amperian current models is useful for studying thin coils or ring permanent magnets. All our analytical expressions are based on elliptic integrals but do not require further numerical treatments. These expressions can be implemented in {\textless}i{\textgreater}Mathematica{\textless}/i{\textgreater} or {\textless}i{\textgreater}Matlab{\textless}/i{\textgreater} and are available online. All our models have been compared to previous analytical and semianalytical models. In addition, these models have been compared to the finite-element method. The computational cost of our analytical model is very low, and we find a very good agreement between our analytical model and the other approaches presented in this paper.},

abstract = {This paper presents new analytic formulas for determining the mutual inductance and the axial magnetic force between two coaxial coils in air, namely a thick circular coil with rectangular cross-section and a thin wall solenoid. The mutual inductance and the magnetic force are expressed as complete elliptical integrals of the first and second kind, Heuman's Lambda function and one well-behaved integral that must be solved numerically. All possible singular cases are automatically handled by the proposed formulas. The results of the work presented here have been verified by the filament method and previously published data. The new formulas provide a substantially simple alternative over previously published approaches, which involve either numerical techniques (finite element method, boundary element method, method of moments) or other semianalytic or analytic approaches.},

abstract = {This paper presents three-dimensional expressions for the optimization of permanent-magnet couplings. First, we give a fully analytical expression of the azimuthal field created by one arc-shaped permanent magnet radially polarized which takes into account its magnetic pole volume density. Such an expression has a very low computational cost and is exact for all points in space. Then, we propose two semianalytical expressions of the azimuthal force and the torque exerted between two arc-shaped permanent magnets. These expressions are valid for thick or thin arc-shaped permanent magnets. Furthermore, this approach allows us to realize easily parametric studies and optimizations. The analytical approach taken in this paper, based on the Coulombian model, is a good alternative compared to the finite element method generally used to study such configurations.},

Box 9400, Providence, Rhode Island 02940 A novel concept for an absolute linear displacement sensor utilizing giant magnetoresistance elements is introduced. This device is based on the division of a magnetically soft layer of a spin-valve device into two antiparallel magnetic domains. The total resistance of the spin valve varies linearly with displacement of the domain wall because of different resistances of the aligned and antialigned magnetic states of the spin valve. Domain-wall translation is achieved by the use of a magnetic wall "trap" generated by permanent magnets. Displacement is thus related directly to the device resistance. Position resolution to date is on the order of 10 ¬µm over ranges of approximately 2 cm and on the order of a micron over reduced ranges. Magnetic hysteresis yields backlash on the order of tens of microns. {\textcopyright}1997 American Institute of Physics PII: S0021-8979(97)65008-2 doi: {\textless}http://scitation.aip.org/jhtml/doi.jsp{\textgreater}10.1063/1.364802 PACS: 07.07.Df, 06.30.Bp, 85.70.Ec, 75.70.Pa, 85.70.Yv Additional Information {\textless}http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal{\&}id=JAPIAU000081000008004284000001{\&}idtype=cvips{\&}gifs=yes{\&}addinfo=yes{\textgreater}  Full Text: [ PDF {\textless}/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf{\&}id=JAPIAU000081000008004284000001{\&}idtype=cvips{\&}prog=normal{\textgreater} (96 kB) ] Order {\textless}/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf{\&}id=JAPIAU000081000008004284000001{\&}idtype=cvips{\&}prog=normal{\textgreater}  References | Scitation Citing Articles {\textless}http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal{\&}id=JAPIAU000081000008004284000001{\&}idtype=cvips{\&}citing=sci{\textgreater} | CrossRef Citing Articles {\textless}http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal{\&}id=JAPIAU000081000008004284000001{\&}idtype=cvips{\&}citing=cross{\textgreater} | All Citing Articles {\textless}http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal{\&}id=JAPIAU000081000008004284000001{\&}idtype=cvips{\&}citing=all{\textgreater} For more information on reference linking in this journal, click here {\textless}http://scitation.aip.org/jhtml/refinfo/refinfo.jsp{\textgreater}.

We demonstrate that our analytical model has both a lower computational cost than the one determined by Babic and a simpler form. Such expressions are also useful to calculate the self inductance of a thick coil. These formulations are suitable for the design of engineering applications involving air coils. All our analytical expressions are implemented in a program freely available online.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the magnetic resonator piano, a hybrid acoustic-electronic instrument extending the traditional grand piano. Sound is produced without loudspeakers using electromagnetic actuators to directly manipulate the piano strings, expanding its vocabulary to include infinite sustain, notes that crescendo from silence, harmonics, and a variety of timbres. A feedback-based approach senses string vibrations from a single pickup on the soundboard, using filters and phase-locked loops to generate signals which reinforce the natural motion of each string. Signal-routing hardware enables coverage of all 88 notes of the piano using a standard digital audio interface. This paper describes the hardware, software, and performing interface of the instrument and presents measurements of amplitude, frequency response, and phase-locked loop performance. Sounds generated by the actuators achieve similar amplitudes to the traditional piano, and while they cannot replicate the rapid attack produced by a...},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in smart structures, particularly in the field of musical acoustics. Control methods, initially developed to reduce vibration and damage, can be a good way to shift modal parameters of a structure in order to modify its dynamic response. This study focuses on smart musical instruments and aims to modify their radiated sound. This is achieved by controlling the modal parameters of the soundboard of a simplified string instrument. A method combining a pole placement algorithm and a time-dimensionless state-derivative control is used and quickly compared to a usual state control method. Then the effect of the mode tuning on the coupling between the string and the soundboard is experimentally studied. Controlling two vibration modes of the soundboard, its acoustic response and the damping of the third partial of the sound are modified. Finally these effects are listened in the radiated sound.},

abstract = {Harmonic input force distortion which arises when systems are excited with electrodynamic exciters is shown to be predominantly second harmonic, the major source of the harmonic distortion being due to the vibration exciter characteristics. These are examined by experimentally determining the magnetic field strength properties of a typical exciter and the results show these to be a non-linear even function. This information is used with the equations of motion of the excited which are simulated on an analog computer. The computed force characteristics are shown to compare very closely with experimental results. The amount of second harmonic force distortion generated at a system resonance is analyzed by considering a simple single degree-of-freedom model. It is shown that the amount of force distortion is related to the damping of the system under test and the ratio of the exciter stiffness to the system stiffness. It is also shown that the force input to a system near a system resonance can vary considerably, even though the input current to the exciter is constant. These effects are shown to be due to the forces arising from the mass and stiffness characteristics of the exciter being used. Experimental tests on a simple system confirm the theoretical predictions. ?? 1979.},

Actuated musical instruments are physical instruments that have been endowed with virtual qualities controlled by a computer in real-time but which are nevertheless tangible. These instruments provide intuitive and engaging new forms of interaction. They are different from traditional (acoustic) and fully automated (robotic) instruments in that they produce sound via vibrating element(s) that are co-manipulated by humans and electromechanical systems. We examine the possibilities that arise when such instruments are played in different performative environments and music-making scenarios, and we postulate that such designs may give rise to new methods of musical performance. The Haptic Drum, the Feedback Resonance Guitar, the Electromagnetically Prepared Piano, the Overtone Fiddle and Teleoperation with Robothands are described, along with musical examples and reflections on the emergent properties of the performance ecologies that these instruments enable. We look at some of the conceptual and perceptual issues introduced by actuated musical instruments, and finally we propose some directions in which such research may be headed in the future},

abstract = {New high-sensitivity solid-state magnetoresistive (MR) sensor technologies offer significant advantages in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) systems. A key advantage of MR sensors is a flat frequency response extending from dc to hundreds of MHz, making them particularly attractive for low-frequency and multi- frequency eddy current detection for deep-flaw detection and depth profiling. MR sensors are mass produced by thin film processing techniques similar to integrated circuit manufacturing, dramatically reducing the cost per sensor. The fabrication process is compatible with silicon circuit technology, allowing integration of sensors with on-chip signal processing. MR sensors can easily be produced in dense arrays for rapid, single-pass scanning of large areas. The small size and low power consumption of these solid-state magnetic sensors enable the assembly of compact arrays of sensors on a variety of substrates as well as on-chip sensor arrays. Arrays have been fabricated with sensor spacing as small as 5 ¬µm. This paper presents a review of the state of the art in MR sensors and applications in NDE. The physical principles, manufacturing process, and performance characteristics of the three main types of MR devices, anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) are discussed. Their performance is compared to other magnetic sensor technologies for NDE applications. Finally, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on NDE applications of MR sensors.},

abstract = {We present exact three-dimensional semi-analytical expressions of the force exerted between two coaxial thick coils with rectangular cross-sections. Then, we present a semi-analytical formulation of their mutual inductance. For this purpose, we have to calculate six and seven integrations for calculating the force and the mutual inductance respectively. After mathematical manipulations, we can obtain semi-analytical formulations based on only two integrations. It is to be noted that such integrals can be evaluated numerically as they are smooth and derivable. Then, we compare our results with the filament and the finite element methods. All the results are in excellent agreement.},

@article{Berdahl2012a,
abstract = {Traditionally, the average professional musician has owned numerous acoustic musical instruments, many of them having distinctive acoustic qualities. However, a modern musician could prefer to have a single musical instrument whose acoustics are programmable by feedback control, where acoustic variables are estimated from sensor measurements in real time and then fed back in order to influence the controlled variables. In this paper, theory is presented that describes stable feedback control of an acoustic musical instrument. The presentation should be accessible to members of the musical acoustics community who may have limited or no experience with feedback control. First, the only control strategy guaranteed to be stable subject to any musical instrument mobility is described: the sensors and actuators must be collocated, and the controller must emulate a physical analog system. Next, the most fundamental feedback controllers and the corresponding physical analog systems are presented. The effects that these controllers have on acoustic musical instruments are described. Finally, practical design challenges are discussed. A proof explains why changing the resonance frequency of a musical resonance requires much more control power than changing the decay time of the resonance.},
